fastJSONex
========

fastJSONex is an extended fork of [fastJSON](https://github.com/mgholam/fastJSON) by the awesome developer [Mehdi Gholam](http://www.codeproject.com/Members/MehdiGholam). fastJSON is the smallest, fastest polymorphic JSON serializer and is released under [The Code Project Open License (CPOL)](http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx)

This extension mostly extends the dynamic class and adds JsonDictionary and JsonList which expose a property containing the original JSON used to generate the dynamic object. I take no credit for the development of fastJSON, all credit goes to the original developer [Mehdi Gholam](http://www.codeproject.com/Members/MehdiGholam)

More information and documentation for fastJSON see the article here : [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/159450/fastJSON](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/159450/fastJSON).
